## 🎯 Background

Sport03 is more than just an app—it’s part of my learning journey.
This is my **second project**, where I applied **data structures and algorithms** into a real-world application.
The goal is to prove that what we often call "theory" can actually play a crucial role once transformed into something practical and useful.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The application is built on top of core **data structures**:

* 🌳 **Tree** → used for efficient player data loading.
* ⏳ **Queue** → implemented to handle schedules in a neat, sequential order (just like a real-life queue).
* 🔄 **SimpleSort** → used for sorting schedules and player data in a straightforward yet effective way.

With this combination, Sport03 isn’t just a note-taking app—it’s an experiment in how algorithms can make team management more optimized.

## 💡 A Note of Wisdom

> *“Learning is like football: it’s not just about winning or losing, but about enjoying the process—training, falling, and rising again stronger.”*

Sport03 represents a small piece of that learning process. It’s far from perfect, but every line of code is a beautiful step forward. 🚀
